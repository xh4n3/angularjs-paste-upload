# angularjs-paste-upload
Uploading images by ngPaste

Simply copy the image to your textbox, the image would get uploaded automatically and return the url back to the textbox.

### Notes
* Tested under Chrome 41
* It cannot be directly used, you should include these code into your own project
* Have a look [here](https://github.com/xh4n3/zone_blog) for further details
